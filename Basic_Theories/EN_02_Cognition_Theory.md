## 1. Introduction

The cognitive layer is the top layer of AgentOS's three-tier architecture, responsible for transforming user intent into executable task plans and coordinating collaborative work among agent teams. Its design is based on the cognitive perspective within the Five-Dimensional Orthogonal System, deeply inspired by cognitive psychology and decision theory, particularly the dual-system cognitive theory, and the feedback concepts from the "Two Engineering Theories" (*Engineering Cybernetics* and *On Systems Engineering*). This document details the theoretical foundations, core components, and operational mechanisms of the cognitive layer.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 Dual-System Cognitive Model

Dual-system theory posits that human thinking is accomplished through the collaboration of two systems:

- **System 1 (Fast System)**: Automatic, intuitive, low-energy consumption, excels at pattern matching and rapid response.
- **System 2 (Slow System)**: Analytical, reasoning-intensive, high-energy consumption, used for complex problems and planning.

AgentOS maps this model to various components of the cognitive layer:

| Component | System 1 Mapping | System 2 Mapping |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| Routing Layer | Rapid intent classification | Complexity assessment and resource matching |
| Dual-Model Collaboration | Auxiliary model rapid validation | Primary model deep reasoning |
| Incremental Planner | Quick response to planned phases | Dynamic adjustment of subsequent planning |
| Scheduler | Fast candidate filtering | Multi-objective optimization selection |

This division of labor enables the cognitive layer to quickly handle simple tasks while engaging in deep thinking for complex scenarios.

### 2.2 Feedback Control Theory

*Engineering Cybernetics* emphasizes that feedback is central to control. The cognitive layer's feedback loops are manifested as:

- **Real-time feedback**: Execution results from the action layer return via `execution_wait`, influencing subsequent planning of the current task.
- **Intra-round feedback**: The incremental planner adjusts dependency relationships based on task completion status.
- **Cross-round feedback**: The evolution committee analyzes cognitive layer statistics and updates strategy parameters.

### 2.3 Comprehensive Integration Method

The "from qualitative to quantitative comprehensive integration" method proposed in *On Systems Engineering* is embodied in the cognitive layer as **multi-strategy collaboration**: planning, collaboration, and scheduling strategies can be independently configured and dynamically combined by the engine to form optimal overall solutions.

## 3. Core Components

### 3.1 Routing Layer

The routing layer is the entry point of the cognitive layer, responsible for converting user input into structured intent. Its core functions include:

- **Intent understanding**: Parsing natural language into goals, constraints, and context.
- **Complexity assessment**: Classifying tasks into simple, complex, and critical categories based on keywords, length, and other features.
- **Resource matching**: Selecting appropriate models (lightweight/most powerful) and token budgets according to complexity.

### 3.2 Dual-Model Collaboration

The dual-model collaboration system is the "thinking engine" of the cognitive layer, realizing the cooperation between System 1 and System 2:

- **Primary Thinker (System 2)**: Uses the most powerful reasoning model for deep planning, reflection, and adjustment.
- **Auxiliary Thinker (System 1)**: Uses lightweight models for quick response, cross-validation, and conflict detection.
- **Arbitration mechanism**: When primary and auxiliary models produce inconsistent conclusions, internal debate is triggered, with audit committee intervention or manual confirmation.

### 3.3 Incremental Planner

The incremental planner abandons the traditional method of planning all steps at once, instead:

- **Phased planning**: Only generates task DAGs for the current phase.
- **Dynamic expansion**: Gradually adds subsequent phase tasks based on execution feedback.
- **Rollback and correction**: When tasks fail, the system can roll back to the previous phase and replace failed nodes.

This design effectively avoids error accumulation in long-sequence tasks.

### 3.4 Scheduler

The scheduler is responsible for selecting appropriate agents from the agent registry to execute tasks. Its core is multi-objective optimization:

$$
\text{Score}(agent) = w_1 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{cost}} + w_2 \cdot \text{success\_rate} + w_3 \cdot \text{trust\_score}
$$

Weights are configurable, supporting cost-priority, performance-priority, trust-priority, and other strategies.

The scheduler also supports:

- **Candidate filtering**: Filtering agents based on task roles (e.g., `product_manager`).
- **Dynamic loading**: Loading agent instances on-demand via `agent_pool` to avoid resource waste.

### 3.5 Pluggable Strategies

The cognitive layer's three major strategies (planning, collaboration, scheduling) are all defined through abstract interfaces and can be dynamically replaced at runtime:

- **Planning strategies**: Hierarchical planning, reactive planning, reflective planning, machine learning planning.
- **Collaboration strategies**: Dual-model collaboration, majority voting, weighted fusion, external arbitration.
- **Scheduling strategies**: Weighted scheduling, round-robin scheduling, priority scheduling, machine learning scheduling.

This design enables system optimization for different scenarios and allows community contributions of new strategies.

## 4. Operational Mechanisms

### 4.1 Processing Flow

1. **User input** → Routing layer parses intent → Complexity assessment → Resource matching.
2. **Primary thinker generates initial plan** → Auxiliary thinker cross-validates → Arbitration if conflicts arise.
3. **Incremental planner generates first-phase task DAG** → Scheduler selects agent for each task.
4. **Action layer executes tasks** → Execution results feed back to cognitive layer.
5. **Incremental planner adjusts subsequent planning based on feedback** → Repeat steps 3-4 until all tasks complete.
6. **Result aggregation** → Return to user while recording statistics (processing time, token consumption, etc.).

### 4.2 Health Checks

The cognitive layer provides health check interfaces returning JSON status, including:

- Current processing task count, average processing time, error rate.
- Strategy loading status, available model list.

This information can be collected by monitoring services for alerting and auto-scaling.

## 5. Summary

Through dual-system theory, feedback control, and comprehensive integration methods, the cognitive layer enables agents to transition from "command response" to "active planning." Its pluggable strategy architecture ensures system flexibility and scalability, providing stable, efficient cognitive services for upper-layer applications.
