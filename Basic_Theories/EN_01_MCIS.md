## Preface

Where does intelligence come from?

The industry has long offered two answers. The first is **data**: intelligence is hidden within vast oceans of data; through massive training, powerful models are forged, and intelligence becomes the crystallization of these models. The second is **algorithms**: intelligence resides within sophisticated algorithmic architectures, emerging naturally through deeper networks and more ingenious reasoning mechanisms.

AgentOS design practice presents a third answer. Building upon both data and algorithms, intelligence can emerge more rapidly from the parallel operation of multiple independent systems.

This third answer, which I term the "Multibody Cybernetic Intelligent System," can be distilled into one core idea: thinking generates intelligence, originating from system parallelism — From thinking emerges intelligence: Multibody Cybernetic Intelligent System.

## Part 1: Four Core Propositions

The Multibody Cybernetic Intelligent System consists of four progressive propositions that collectively answer the fundamental question: how does intelligence emerge from systems?

### 1. Multibody Independence: Orthogonality of Dimensions

Any complex system can be examined from multiple perspectives.

The systems perspective addresses "how to maintain dynamic equilibrium," the kernel perspective addresses "what the kernel should and should not do," the cognitive perspective addresses "how agents make decisions efficiently and reliably," the engineering perspective addresses "how to write correct, maintainable code," and the design aesthetics perspective addresses "how to make engineering an art."

These perspectives are independent of each other, each with its own logic and principles. We call each such perspective a "body." Bodies satisfy **orthogonality**: modifying the core principles of one body does not affect the core logic of other bodies.

**Formally**, let the dimension set be \( D = \{d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n\} \). For any \( i \neq j \), modifying the core principles \( P_i \) of \( d_i \) does not cause logical contradictions or require coordinated modifications to the core principles \( P_j \) of \( d_j \).

Orthogonality ensures that dimensions can evolve independently. Changes in naming conventions in the aesthetics dimension do not affect IPC mechanisms in the kernel; upgrades to the testing framework in the engineering perspective do not affect dual-system collaboration logic in the cognitive perspective. This independence is the cornerstone of the Multibody Cybernetic Intelligent System.

### 2. Parallel Operation: Temporal Overlap

Independence does not mean isolation. All dimensions function simultaneously and continuously throughout the system's lifecycle. There is no serial dependency like "design the systems perspective first, then the kernel perspective."

Each dimension has its own "perception-decision-execution-feedback" closed loop.

The systems perspective has its feedback (real-time monitoring, health checks), the kernel perspective has its feedback (IPC latency, task scheduling efficiency), and the cognitive perspective has its feedback (execution results revising plans). These loops overlap in time—they run concurrently and interweave—while remaining separated in space through standardized interfaces (system calls, event channels, message queues) rather than direct entanglement.

Parallel operation is the temporal condition for intelligence emergence. Only when all dimensions remain continuously active can their interactions produce collective intelligence that transcends any single dimension.

### 3. Cybernetic Coupling: The Discipline of Feedback

Interactions between dimensions are not arbitrary. The Multibody Cybernetic Intelligent System borrows core ideas from cybernetics, strictly limiting coupling between bodies to three feedback mechanisms:

- **Negative feedback**: Maintains overall stability and eliminates deviations. For example, execution layer results return to the cognitive layer to revise subsequent plans.
- **Positive feedback**: Amplifies local advantages and promotes evolution. For example, successful task patterns are reinforced and stored in long-term memory, enabling similar tasks to be completed faster in the future.
- **Feedforward**: Predicts external disturbances and makes adjustments in advance. For example, based on historical trends in system load, resources are pre-allocated or elastic scaling is triggered.

These three feedback mechanisms constitute the rules for interaction between dimensions. Coupling must be implemented through well-defined interface contracts, avoiding direct calls or shared state between bodies. This discipline preserves the possibility of mutual influence while preventing chaotic entanglement.

### 4. Intelligence Emergence: The Essence of Holistic Transcendence

When multiple independent bodies operate in parallel within a system and are coupled through cybernetic feedback, the system as a whole exhibits intelligent behaviors that no single dimension possesses.

This phenomenon can be understood through concrete mechanisms. For example:

- Dual-system collaboration (cognitive perspective) enables fast and slow models to divide labor; resource determinism (engineering perspective) makes memory and thread management predictable. When these two dimensions operate in parallel with feedback, the system simultaneously achieves high efficiency (fast models handle routine tasks) and high reliability (slow models handle exceptions, no resource leaks). This combined capability of "efficient and reliable" cannot be achieved by any single dimension alone.
- Memory rolling (cognitive perspective) abstracts experiences into patterns layer by layer; security domes (engineering perspective) make all operations auditable and isolated. Together, the system can learn from history while maintaining security boundaries during learning—learning and security are no longer mutually constraining but become mutually reinforcing holistic characteristics.

**Formally**, let the overall system performance on task \( T \) be \( P_{\text{total}} \), and the expected performance from linearly summing independently optimized dimensions be \( P_{\text{sum}} \). If \( P_{\text{total}} > P_{\text{sum}} \) with statistically significant difference, emergence is judged to have occurred.

Intelligence emergence is the ultimate goal pursued by the Multibody Cybernetic Intelligent System and the architectural realization of the concept that "thinking generates intelligence."

## Part 2: The Principle of Appropriateness

The four propositions answer "what is the Multibody Cybernetic Intelligent System?" The next question is: which dimensions should be chosen?

The system's answer is: dimensions are not about quantity but about appropriateness. It does not pursue maximizing the number of dimensions but seeks the minimal complete set of orthogonal dimensions that cover all fundamental concerns in system design.

Why not more dimensions? Because each additional dimension requires designers to master another independent principle system (cognitive overload); pairwise interactions between dimensions grow at \( O(n^2) \) (interaction explosion); the first few dimensions cover the most significant design concerns, while subsequent dimensions are often subdivisions or intersections of existing ones (diminishing marginal returns); and maintaining true orthogonality becomes more difficult with more dimensions (orthogonality difficulty).

So what kind of dimensions are appropriate? The Multibody Cybernetic Intelligent System proposes four criteria.

### Criterion 1: Fundamentality

Does this dimension touch upon fundamental problems in system design?

By fundamental, we mean that ignoring this problem would cause the system to lose its essential nature. For example, "how complex systems maintain dynamic equilibrium" is a fundamental problem, while "what format should logs use" is a derived problem that can be categorized under engineering or aesthetics without needing to be an independent dimension.

### Criterion 2: Irreducibility

Can the problems of this dimension be adequately covered by existing dimensions?

If existing dimensions can already explain more than 80% of this dimension's design decisions, it is not independent. Each dimension must represent a unique class of properties that cannot be reduced or substituted by other dimensions.

### Criterion 3: Orthogonalizability

Does modifying this dimension's core principles affect other dimensions' core logic?

If two dimensions frequently require synchronized modifications, they are not orthogonal and should be merged or re-divided. The system recommends setting a quantitative threshold: modifications to one dimension's principles should not affect more than 10% of other dimensions' principles.

### Criterion 4: Practicality

Can this dimension provide clear, actionable decision-making guidance?

Each dimension should derive at least three verifiable specific principles. If a dimension is too abstract to be implemented in concrete code reviews or design evaluations, it is unsuitable as an independent dimension.

These four criteria—fundamentality, irreducibility, orthogonalizability, and practicality—constitute the basic guidelines for dimension selection. Any candidate dimension must pass all four tests to be included in the system.

Dimension evolution also requires discipline:

- **Adding dimensions**: Proposal → Four-criteria review → Pilot validation → Formal integration
- **Removing or merging dimensions**: Identify redundancy → Reconstruct principle attribution → Deprecation announcement (retain for two minor versions) → Cleanup

## Part 3: From Five-Dimensional Orthogonality to Multibody System

In AgentOS V1.x, the Multibody Cybernetic Intelligent System is instantiated as five concrete dimensions:

| Dimension | Core Question | Number of Principles |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| Systems Perspective | How do complex systems maintain dynamic equilibrium? | 4 |
| Kernel Perspective | What should the kernel do, and what should it not do? | 4 |
| Cognitive Perspective | How do agents make decisions efficiently and reliably? | 4 |
| Engineering Perspective | How to build maintainable, testable, evolvable systems? | 8 |
| Design Aesthetics | How to make engineering an art? | 4 |

These five dimensions are called the "Five-Dimensional Orthogonal System." They represent the concrete implementation of the Multibody Cybernetic Intelligent System in the AgentOS project, validated through practice from V1.0 to V1.8 as a stable, effective **minimal complete set** for AgentOS.

However, the Multibody Cybernetic Intelligent System itself is not bound to the number "five." It is an open philosophical framework. In the future, if new fundamental design concerns emerge that cannot be covered by the existing five dimensions—such as an "ethical dimension" or "economic dimension"—and they pass the four-criteria review, a sixth dimension can be formally introduced. Similarly, if practice shows that two dimensions significantly overlap, they should be merged.

Five dimensions represent the current best instance, not eternal dogma.

## Part 4: Philosophical Foundation: Dialogue with Dialectical Materialism

The Multibody Cybernetic Intelligent System is more than just an engineering methodology. It has deep philosophical roots and aligns closely with dialectical materialism (the theory of contradiction and the theory of practice).

The fundamentality criterion corresponds to "grasping the principal contradiction." The fundamental cause of development lies not outside but inside things, in their internal contradictions. Requiring each dimension to touch fundamental contradictions aims to grasp the principal contradiction in system design, avoiding wasted effort on secondary issues.

The irreducibility criterion corresponds to "the particularity of contradiction." Each contradiction has its unique essence. The contradiction in the systems perspective (coordination of whole and parts) and the contradiction in the kernel perspective (division of responsibilities and boundaries) are different types of contradictions that cannot be reduced to each other. Acknowledging irreducibility means recognizing the diversity of contradictions.

The orthogonalizability criterion corresponds to "the relative independence of contradictions." Contradictory aspects are both united and struggle, possessing relative independence. In the Multibody Cybernetic Intelligent System, orthogonal boundaries between dimensions embody this relative independence. They can evolve separately while influencing each other through feedback.

The practicality criterion corresponds to "practice is the sole criterion for testing truth." The standard of truth can only be practice. The value of a dimension depends not on its theoretical elegance but on whether it can guide development in practice, be verified, and produce better systems. The practicality criterion anchors the entire theory in the foundation of practice.

The minimal complete set principle reflects "quantitative change leading to qualitative change." When the accumulation of dimension numbers exceeds a certain threshold, the system's manageability undergoes qualitative change, shifting from "clarity" to "chaos." The principle of appropriateness consciously applies this law.

The Multibody Cybernetic Intelligent System did not emerge from pure speculation. It was born from AgentOS development practice, refined from code, architecture, and repeated trial and error. It acknowledges its own historicity—today's Five-Dimensional Orthogonal System is the optimal solution at the current stage, but tomorrow it may be revised or expanded by new practice. It rejects dogmatization and advocates testing and development through practice. This represents a concrete application of dialectical materialist epistemology in software engineering.

## Part 5: How the Theory Can Be Tested and Falsified

A theory that cannot be falsified is difficult to recognize as scientific. The Multibody Cybernetic Intelligent System proposes the following falsifiable propositions:

1. **Emergence Proposition**: If a system strictly following the Multibody Cybernetic Intelligent System does not show significantly better overall intelligent performance than the linear sum of independently optimized dimensions, the emergence hypothesis is falsified.

2. **Minimal Complete Set Proposition**: If a system not following the "minimal complete set" principle (with too many or too few dimensions) shows significantly better maintainability and intelligent performance than a system following this principle, the appropriateness principle is falsified.

3. **Criteria Sufficiency Proposition**: If a dimension that passes the four-criteria review cannot derive at least three verifiable principles in practice, the validity of these criteria is called into question.

Currently, the Multibody Cybernetic Intelligent System has only been applied in the AgentOS project and has not undergone large-scale, multi-project independent validation. Its true value needs to be tested in broader engineering practice. This is precisely what the practicality criterion demands of the theory itself.

## Conclusion

The Multibody Cybernetic Intelligent System attempts to answer a fundamental question: how does intelligence arise?

Its answer is: intelligence does not flow from a single source but emerges from the parallel operation of multiple independent systems. Multiple independent "bodies" operate in parallel, coupled through cybernetic feedback, and the system as a whole produces intelligent characteristics that no single dimension possesses.

Not all dimensions should be retained—only those that are fundamental, irreducible, orthogonalizable, and practical. The number five is not immutable; five dimensions are merely the current best instance and can grow in the future.

This is the Multibody Cybernetic Intelligent System—a theory about how to organize complex systems to emerge intelligence. It is not a rigid dogma but an operational thinking framework: decompose systems into independent dimensions, let them operate in parallel, couple them through feedback, and ultimately achieve collective intelligence.
