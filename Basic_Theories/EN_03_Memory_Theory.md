## 1. Introduction

Memory is core to agents' accumulation of experience and realization of evolution. Airymax's memory layer (MemoryRovol) is a four-layer rolling memory system designed based on the engineering perspective within the Five-Dimensional Orthogonal System. Inspired by neural network hierarchical abstraction ideas and human hippocampal-neocortical memory consolidation mechanisms, it achieves layer-by-layer sublimation from raw events to abstract rules. This document details its theoretical foundations, four-layer architecture, and key mechanisms.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 Convolutional Neural Networks and Hierarchical Abstraction

Convolutional neural networks progressively abstract raw pixels into edges, textures, objects, and scenes through multiple layers of convolution and pooling. MemoryRovol borrows this idea, dividing memory processing into four layers:

| Layer | Abstraction Type | Analogy |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| L1 Raw Volume | Raw event streams | Input layer (pixels) |
| L2 Feature Layer | Semantic feature vectors | Convolutional layer (edges, textures) |
| L3 Structural Layer | Relation binding | Fully connected layer (objects) |
| L4 Pattern Layer | Abstract rules | Output layer (scenes) |

### 2.2 Human Memory System

Neuroscientific research shows that human memory is divided into:

- **Hippocampus**: Rapidly encodes episodic memories, preserving raw traces.
- **Entorhinal cortex**: Extracts features and establishes indices.
- **Neocortex**: Long-term consolidation, forming semantic knowledge.

MemoryRovol's four-layer architecture highly corresponds to this physiological mechanism:

| MemoryRovol | Brain Region | Function |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| L1 Raw Volume | Hippocampus CA3 | Raw episodic traces |
| L2 Feature Layer | Entorhinal cortex | Feature extraction and indexing |
| L3 Structural Layer | Hippocampal-neocortical pathway | Relation binding and consolidation |
| L4 Pattern Layer | Prefrontal cortex | Abstract rules and schemas |

### 2.3 Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve

Hermann Ebbinghaus discovered that human forgetting follows an exponential decay pattern. MemoryRovol formalizes this pattern as a forgetting weight:

$$
R(t) = e^{-t/\tau}
$$

where $t$ is the time interval and $\tau$ is the decay constant (default 7 days). This weight affects retrieval priority, simulating natural memory aging.

> **Terminology Standardization Note**: The forgetting formula uniformly uses the $\tau$ notation (consistent with ARCHITECTURAL_PRINCIPLES.md C-4). The historical $\lambda$ notation ($R = e^{-\lambda t}$) is mathematically equivalent ($\lambda = 1/\tau$), but this specification uniformly uses $\tau$ for terminology consistency. See TERMINOLOGY.md v3.0 ruling #6.

### 2.4 Topological Data Analysis

Persistent homology is a core tool in topological data analysis for identifying stable topological features in datasets. MemoryRovol uses it to mine persistent patterns from massive memories, ignoring noise interference. The lifetime (birth-death) of a persistent homology generator $\gamma$ reflects feature stability—longer lifetimes indicate more likely true patterns.

## 3. Four-Layer Architecture Details

### 3.1 L1 Raw Volume

**Storage**: Raw memory data (conversations, events, files), append-only writing, never modified. Each record includes metadata (timestamp, source, TraceID).

**Mathematical form**: Each memory is encoded as a high-order tensor:

$$
\mathcal{T}(m) = \bigotimes_{i=1}^{k} \mathbf{v}_i
$$

where $\mathbf{v}_i$ are vectorized representations of different modalities (text, images, structured attributes).

### 3.2 L2 Feature Layer

**Function**: Maps raw memories to high-dimensional semantic space via embedding models, generating feature vectors. Supports hybrid retrieval (vector+BM25), ensuring semantically similar memories are close in feature space.

**Key property**: The embedding mapping $\Phi$ satisfies Lipschitz continuity:

$$
|\Phi(m_1) - \Phi(m_2)| \leq L \cdot d(m_1, m_2)
$$

### 3.3 L3 Structural Layer

**Function**: Encodes structural relationships between memories (temporal, causal, attributive) through a binding operator $\otimes$. The binding operator supports non-commutative binding, with $Q$ parameter controlling capacity-precision tradeoff:

$$
(\mathbf{a} \otimes \mathbf{b}) = \text{IDFT}\left( \text{DFT}(\mathbf{a}) \odot_Q \text{DFT}(\mathbf{b}) \right)
$$

Compound events are encoded via a superposition operator $\oplus$:

$$
\Psi(\{m_i\}) = \bigoplus_{i} \left( \bigotimes_{j \in \text{rel}(i)} \Phi(m_j) \right)
$$

### 3.4 L4 Pattern Layer

**Function**: Mines stable patterns via persistent homology, generating reusable rules. Filtered manifold:

$$
\mathcal{M}_\epsilon = \{ m \in \mathcal{M} : \rho(m, q) < \epsilon \}
$$

The most persistent generator $\gamma$ satisfies $\text{Persistence}(\gamma) > \theta$, where $\theta$ is the noise threshold $\mu_{\text{noise}} + 3\sigma_{\text{noise}}$.

## 4. Key Mechanisms

### 4.1 Storage-Usage Separation

L1 Raw Volume is permanently preserved, while L2-L4 store only indices and features, avoiding information loss. During retrieval, features locate memories, then original data is mounted from L1, ensuring factual integrity.

### 4.2 Retrieval Dynamics

Based on attractor dynamics of modern Hopfield networks:

$$
\mathbf{z}(t+1) = \sigma\left( \sum_{\mu} \mathbf{m}^{\mu} (\mathbf{m}^{\mu} \cdot \mathbf{z}(t)) \right)
$$

Partial cues $\mathbf{z}(0)$ iteratively converge to complete memory $\mathbf{m}^*$, achieving pattern completion.

### 4.3 Forgetting and Consolidation

- **Forgetting**: Retrieval weights decay exponentially with age; low-weight memories are pruned or archived.
- **Consolidation**: Frequently used or high-value memories are extracted as L4 patterns, injected into rule libraries, and exempt from forgetting.

### 4.4 Memory Reconsolidation

After each retrieval, memories update association weights based on current context, simulating human "reconstructive recall," optimizing memories through use.

## 5. Collaboration with Cognitive and Action Layers

- **Cognitive layer**: Retrieves relevant memories via `memory_query` to assist decision-making; records decision processes via `memory_write`.
- **Action layer**: Calls `memory_mount` before/after execution to load required memories; records tool invocation results via `audit_record`.

The memory layer interacts with the kernel through system calls, maintaining kernel purity.

## 6. Summary

MemoryRovol deeply integrates convolutional neural network hierarchical abstraction ideas with human memory mechanisms, achieving memory storage, indexing, structuring, abstraction, and forgetting through a four-layer rolling architecture. It ensures both the integrity of original facts and supports extracting reusable rules from experience, serving as the core foundation for Airymax's self-evolution.
