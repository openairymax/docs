## 1. Introduction

Airymax is an operating system for multi-agent collaboration, designed to evolve agents from single executors into dynamically formable, self-evolving teams. Its design is rooted in the Five-Dimensional Orthogonal System, encompassing systems perspective, kernel perspective, cognitive perspective, engineering perspective, and design aesthetics. Theoretical foundations include the core ideas of the "Two Engineering Theories," Daniel Kahneman's dual-system cognitive theory, MicroCoreRT philosophy, and Jobsian design aesthetics. This document systematically elaborates Airymax's core design principles, providing a unified theoretical foundation for the entire project.

## 2. Two Engineering Theories: Unity of Control and Systems

### 2.1 Feedback Loops: The Core of Cybernetics

*Engineering Cybernetics* states that any control system relies on feedback to correct deviations. Airymax integrates feedback throughout every layer:

- **Real-time feedback**: Action layer execution results return to the cognitive layer in real time, revising current task planning.
- **Intra-round feedback**: The incremental planner adjusts subsequent phase task graphs based on execution feedback.
- **Cross-round feedback**: The evolution committee updates role rules and technical specifications based on historical data, enabling system self-optimization.

This mechanism ensures Airymax can both respond rapidly to changes and learn from historical experience.

### 2.2 Hierarchical Decomposition: The Systems Engineering Approach

*On Systems Engineering* emphasizes that complex systems should be decomposed hierarchically. Airymax adopts a three-layer cognitive loop structure:

- **Cognitive layer**: Responsible for intent understanding, task planning, and scheduling decisions.
- **Action layer**: Responsible for concrete execution, consisting of specialized agent pools and pluggable execution units.
- **Memory and evolution layer**: Responsible for memory storage, pattern mining, and rule updates.

Each layer is further subdivided internally; for example, the memory layer is divided into L1 Raw Volume, L2 Feature Layer, L3 Structural Layer, and L4 Pattern Layer, forming clear abstraction hierarchies that reduce system complexity.

### 2.3 Overall Design Department: Coordinating the Whole

*On Systems Engineering* proposes the "overall design department" concept, responsible for overall coordination and trade-offs. In Airymax, the **cognitive layer** plays this role: it does not execute specific tasks but is responsible for intent decomposition, strategy selection, and agent scheduling, ensuring optimal global objectives.

## 3. Dual-System Theory: Collaboration of Fast and Slow

Daniel Kahneman proposes in *Thinking, Fast and Slow* that human thinking comprises two systems:

- **System 1**: Fast, intuitive, automatic, used for daily decisions.
- **System 2**: Slow, analytical, deliberative, used for complex reasoning.

Airymax embeds this theory into its architecture:

- **Cognitive layer**: System 2 deep planning, System 1 rapid classification and cross-validation.
- **Action layer**: System 1 fast execution, System 2 result verification and exception handling.
- **Memory layer**: System 1 rapid retrieval, System 2 deep pattern mining.

The collaboration of dual systems enables the system to efficiently handle routine tasks while confronting complex challenges.

## 4. MicroCoreRT and Pure Kernel

Airymax follows MicroCoreRT design philosophy:

- **Minimalist kernel**: The `agentos/atoms/` directory contains only the most fundamental foundations (IPC, memory management with pooling and guard, task scheduling, time services, as well as OOM handling, observability, and error handling—six major subsystems in total) along with the two major subsystems `coreloopthree` and `memoryrovol`.
- **Externalized services**: All user-mode services (e.g., LLM, marketplace, monitoring) run as independent daemon processes (`agentos/daemon/`), interacting with the kernel through system calls.
- **Security isolation**: The `agentos/cupolas/` module provides security mechanisms like virtual workstations, permission arbitration, and input sanitization, decoupled from the kernel.

This design ensures kernel stability and portability while allowing services to evolve independently.

## 5. Modularity and Pluggability

Every component of Airymax is designed as a pluggable strategy:

- **Cognitive strategies**: Planning (hierarchical/reactive/reflective/ML), collaboration (dual-model/majority voting/weighted), scheduling (weighted/round-robin/priority/ML) can all be dynamically replaced.
- **Execution units**: Tools, code, APIs, files, and other units are dynamically loaded through a registry, enabling community contributions of new units.
- **Memory strategies**: Forgetting curve types, clustering algorithms, rule generators are all configurable.

This design allows system optimization for different scenarios and encourages community contributions.

## 6. Security by Design

Security is no longer an add-on feature but embedded in system design:

- **Virtual workstations**: Each agent runs in an independent sandbox (process or container) with limited resources and optional network access.
- **Permission arbitration**: Based on YAML rules supporting wildcards and caching, dynamically reloadable.
- **Input sanitization**: Rule-based filtering using regular expressions, capable of replacing or deleting malicious content.
- **Audit logs**: Asynchronous writing, supporting rotation and querying, recording all sensitive operations.

Security mechanisms permeate the entire system, covering from kernel to service layers.

## 7. Observability

Airymax has built-in comprehensive observability support:

- **Structured logging**: Unified log format supporting TraceID propagation for distributed tracing.
- **Metrics collection**: Counters, gauges, histograms supporting Prometheus export.
- **Distributed tracing**: Tracing data based on OpenTelemetry, recording full request chains.
- **Health checks**: Each component provides health status JSON interfaces for easy monitoring system integration.

## 8. Summary

Airymax's design principles integrate the systems thinking of the Two Engineering Theories, the cognitive model of dual-system theory, and the MicroCoreRT philosophy of modern operating systems. It pursues **pure kernel, independent services, security by design, and comprehensive observability**, providing a stable, efficient, evolvable operational foundation for agent teams.
